# Todo

Todo is a todo list manager compatible with the todo.txt format.

## The Command

### Install

To install from source, you'll need [Go](https://golang.org) installed. With a properly configured
`GOPATH`, run `go get github.com/millere/todo/...`. The compiled `todo` binary will be placed in `$GOPATH/bin`.

### Usage

NOTE: THIS IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT. Stuff probably doesn't work right.

## The Library

As much functionality of the command as possible has been implemented in the library.
